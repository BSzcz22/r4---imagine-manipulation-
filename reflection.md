Brendan Reflection:
I worked on this project with Seth Roth and Justin Cartegenova. For this project, my partners and I each made a fiter for the image of GA (3 filters total). The filter I made randomized the pixel colors in the image when the correct key is pressed. In this project, I made the most use of functions and loops, which is shown in the code for my filter. After connecting a key to my filter, I spent a lot of time figuring out how to change the pixel color, I kept trying different things until I determined that "random" can be used to create different pixel colors. I chose to submit this project for the wrap up assignment because I was able to figure out how to randomize the pixel color without any outside resources, which is something I'm proud of considering the time and effort I put in.
